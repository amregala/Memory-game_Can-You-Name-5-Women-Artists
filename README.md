# Can you name 5 women artists?
 
## Project Description
The concept for this game is inspired by a social media campaign from the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA), which aims to call attention to the inequities present in the art world in which - women remain dramatically underrepresented and undervalued in museums, galleries and auctions houses - by asking, **Can you name five women artists?** 

More often than not people can barely name one women artist and with that question in mind this game was created to help people learn the names of more women artists. 

The game is a variation of the card game concentration (also known as memory) where a set number of cards are shuffled and laid face down on a surface, the ultimate aim being to match pairs of alike cards/images. Each turn the player has an opportunity to flip 2 cards over. If the chosen cards **DO NOT** match the cards are flipped back over. If the choosen cards **MATCH**, the cards stay flipped over and the player gets 10 points. Regardless of a match or not the names of the women artists whose images appear on the cards display on a side screen display.
