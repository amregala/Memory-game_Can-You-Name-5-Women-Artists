        Since 2016, the National Museum of Women in the Arts (NMWA) has been
        asking this question on social media each March during Women's History
        Month. Using the hastag #5WomenArtists, the campaign calls attention to
        the fact that women have not been treated equally in the art world, and
        today they remain dramatically underrepresented and undervalued in
        museums, galleries, and auction houses.
